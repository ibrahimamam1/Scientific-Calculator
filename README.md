# Scientific-Calculator
Scientific Calculator built Using C

This project is a console-based scientific calculator implemented in C. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing various scientific calculations, including basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, exponentiation, logarithms, and more.

Key Features:

    Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    Trigonometric functions: Sine, cosine, and tangent.
    Exponentiation: Raise a number to a specified power.
    Logarithmic functions: Natural logarithm and logarithm with custom base.
    Parentheses support: Evaluate expressions within parentheses.
    Memory functions: Store and recall intermediate results.
    Clear and informative error messages for input validation.



### Available Commands

- `equation` or `eqn`: Solves two-variable or three-variable equations.
- `base` or `base conversion`: Converts a number between different bases.
- `matrix`: Performs matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- `vector`: Performs vector operations (not implemented).
- `log <value>`: Calculate the natural logarithm of a value.
- `sin <angle>`: Calculate the sine of an angle (in degrees or radians).
- `cos <angle>`: Calculate the cosine of an angle (in degrees or radians).
- `sqrt <value>`: Calculate the square root of a value.
- `exp <value>`: Calculate the exponential of a value.
- `help`: Display available commands and their descriptions.

### Example Usage

1. For matrix addition:
   - Run the program and enter `matrix` as the operation.
   - Choose operation type `1` for matrix addition.
   - Enter the number of rows and columns for the matrices.
   - Input the elements of the matrices as prompted.
   - The result of the matrix addition will be displayed.

2. For calculating the sine of an angle:
   - Enter `sin` followed by the angle value (in degrees or radians) when prompted.
   - The sine of the angle will be displayed.

3. For computing the natural logarithm:
   - Enter `log` followed by the number when prompted.
   - The natural logarithm of the number will be displayed.
