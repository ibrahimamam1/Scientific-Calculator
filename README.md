# Scientific-Calculator
Scientific Calculator built Using C

This project is a console-based scientific calculator implemented in C. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing various scientific calculations, including basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, exponentiation, logarithms, and more.

Key Features:

    Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    Trigonometric functions: Sine, cosine, and tangent.
    Exponentiation: Raise a number to a specified power.
    Logarithmic functions: Natural logarithm and logarithm with custom base.
    Parentheses support: Evaluate expressions within parentheses.
    Memory functions: Store and recall intermediate results.
    Clear and informative error messages for input validation.

This project serves as a learning exercise in C programming and showcases the implementation of a console-based scientific calculator.

Feel free to contribute to this project by adding additional features, improving existing functionality, or enhancing the user interface. Your contributions are welcome, and together we can create an even more robust and versatile scientific calculator.
